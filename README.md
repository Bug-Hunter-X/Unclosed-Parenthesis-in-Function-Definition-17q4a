# Unclosed Parenthesis in Function Definition

This repository demonstrates a common Python error: an unclosed parenthesis in a function definition.  The error results in a `SyntaxError` because the interpreter cannot parse the incomplete expression.

The `bug.py` file contains the erroneous code.  The `bugSolution.py` file shows the corrected version.

This example highlights the importance of careful code writing and thorough testing to avoid such syntax errors.
